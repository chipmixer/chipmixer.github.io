<h1>Best practices of Bitcoin mixing in 2021</h1>

<h3>No web-wallets</h3>
<p>
  This is not "best practice". It is basic rule of mixing.
</p>

<h3>Separate unmixed and mixed wallets</h3>
<p>
  If you are importing or sweeping mixed funds into same wallet as your
  unmixed funds then sooner or later your wallet will join them.
  Keep separate wallets. If it helps - use different software for both.
</p>

<h3>Active wallets require periodical mixing</h3>
<p>
  Mixing may erase your on-chain history but if you are making multiple transactions
  with multiple people your new history grows. Pick reasonable number and mix
  your used funds after. Do not mix unspent chips - they have no history and
  you will get better privacy this way.
</p>

<h3>Delay your withdrawal</h3>
<p>
  Your deposit transaction is recorded on-chain. If you withdraw instantly
  especially large sum or unusual combination of chips at once then it
  can decrease your privacy. On the other hand if you keep some time between
  receiving chips and using private keys then your privacy grows with
  each ChipMixer deposit and withdrawal.
</p>

<h3>Plan your chip size</h3>
<p>
  You know you will pay 3.5 mBTC every week. You mix 12 mBTC and receive 8 mBTC
  and 4 mBTC chip. If you withdraw them like this - two of your transactions
  will be linked. It is better to split 8 mBTC into two 4 mBTC chips to have
  them ready for each payment.
</p>

<h3>Change handling is dangerous</h3>
<p>
  You spend 2.5 mBTC out of 4 mBTC chip. Then 7 mBTC out of 8 mBTC chips.
  You have 1.5 mBTC and 1 mBTC change outputs. If you join them - your previous
  transactions will join. If you keep them - sooner or later your wallet will
  use them and you will not know when.
</p>
<p>
  Use cryptocurrency services that allows you to create multiple deposit addresses
  to join them off-chain. You can also send them to ChipMixer separate sessions
  to withdraw them as chips. Just remember that minimal value is 1 mBTC and sending
  between 1-2 mBTC will give you only 1 mBTC chip and donate rest.
</p>

<h3>Try to keep chips out of wallet</h3>
<p>
  Bitcoin wallet is the best place to keep Bitcoin private keys but sometimes
  it is not. For example Electrum thin-wallet will ask server to fetch
  your transactions disclosing all public addresses. If you keep chip private keys
  out of Electrum wallet till you want to spend them - they will not be known
  as owned and withdrawn till then.
